# fold-to-ascii-ts

A JavaScript port of the Apache Lucene ASCII Folding Filter that converts alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic Unicode characters which are not in the first 127 ASCII characters (the "Basic Latin" Unicode block) into their ASCII equivalents.

# Documentation

## Installation

Using npm:
`npm install --save @pexxi/fold-to-ascii-ts`

Using yarn:
`yarn add @pexxi/fold-to-ascii-ts`

## Usage

There are two different modes of operation:

1.  Replace all known non-ASCII characters with appropriate replacements, replace the unknown ones with a fallback (`foldReplacing`).
2.  Replace all known non-ASCII characters with appropriate replacements, maintain the unknown ones (`foldMaintaining`).

The difference in output only manifests if the inputs contain characters without known replacements:

```TypeScript
import ASCIIFolder from "fold-to-ascii-ts");

// Some Characters have no defined replacement.
// Specify a fixed replacement character (defaults to the empty string).
ASCIIFolder.foldReplacing("LÃ¶rem ðŸ¤§ Ã«ripuÃ®t") === "Lorem  eripuit";
ASCIIFolder.foldReplacing("LÃ¶rem ðŸ¤§ Ã«ripuÃ®t", "X") === "Lorem XX eripuit";

ASCIIFolder.foldMaintaining("LÃ¶rem ðŸ¤§ Ã«ripuÃ®t") === "Lorem ðŸ¤§ eripuit";
```

## Tests

`npm test`
